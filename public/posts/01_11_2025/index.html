Financial From a financial standpoint because of my job I am in a pretty good position. I do need to build up an emergency fund, which I was going to do regardless if I was moving to San Diego.

<p>My desire to move to San Diego (Southern California) has been intensifying recently. I wanted to see what I need to do to be able to move to San Diego in 3 years. I gave ChatGPT my information from a financial and job experience standpoint.</p>
<h3 id="financial">Financial<a href="#financial" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<p>From a financial standpoint because of my job I am in a pretty good position. I do need to build up an emergency fund, which I was going to do regardless if I was moving to San Diego. The cost of living in Chicago is not that much different from San Diego in terms of apartments. The amenities of the apartment/building might be a little different but that is negated by the fact you are within a walkable distance to the beach in San Diego and the weather is always beautiful.</p>
<h3 id="job-experience">Job Experience<a href="#job-experience" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<p>This all comes down to job experience, unfortunately my company doesn&rsquo;t have an office branch in/near San Diego. Working fully remote with my current employer is a possibility, but I don&rsquo;t want to just relay on that. Lucky for me San Diego has a technology sector, specifically in data science. If I can position myself with the data solutions my company has in the first year, it can make me desirable when the time comes to try and find a job in the San Diego job market.</p>
<p>Companies to look into are</p>
<ul>
<li>Qualcomm</li>
<li>Teradata</li>
<li>ServiceNow</li>
</ul>
<p>Using my employer&rsquo;s tuition reimbursement benefit to get a Master&rsquo;s in Data Analytics in the 3 years while I prepare myself would be tremendously beneficial.</p>
<h3 id="scouting">Scouting<a href="#scouting" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<p>I need to explore San Diego and other Southern California areas (Oceanside, Orange County). I think the minimum would have to be 2 trips a year to get a sense of the city. Discover the nice areas and the areas to stay away from. Also to discover the businesses that make living in San Diego worthwhile.</p>
<p>This requires a lot more information so I will continue this thought in another post.</p>
