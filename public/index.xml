      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-into-snowboarding&#34;&gt;Getting into snowboarding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been on the lookout for some new hobbies to get into once I start my new job. Snowboarding is something that has been on my mind for years, I think now is the perfect time to fully get into it. The timing seems a bit off since its mid February and winter is coming to an end. To my surprise there are a couple all year long indoor facilities near me. I still need to look into the pricing, but it looks like i can snowboard all year long!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I have been on the lookout for some new hobbies to get into once I start my new job. Snowboarding is something that has been on my mind for years, I think now is the perfect time to fully get into it. The timing seems a bit off since its mid February and winter is coming to an end. To my surprise there are a couple all year long indoor facilities near me. I still need to look into the pricing, but it looks like i can snowboard all year long!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-criteria-for-a-hobby&#34;&gt;My criteria for a hobby&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe there needs to be 4 aspects for a hobby to be successful to me and snowboarding has all 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travel aspect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can the hobby lead to traveling around the US or another country?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I am lucky to have an indoor facility near me to practice any weekend I want. However, there are many outdoor facilities/resorts in Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, Michigan, or even Minnesota. The further I go out the more time i would need to plan, but its nice that I can travel to different places centered around snowboarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top resorts in the US are in Colorado, Utah, California, and Vermont (when will I ever have the desire to visit Vermont if it is not for snowboarding?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gadget aspect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there specific gadgets/attire associated with the hobby?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snowboarding is all about gadgets/attire. It has a high upfront cost to stay warm while spending hours outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;snowboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;braces for the snowboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;beanie&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helmet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;goggles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;balaclava&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jacket&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;layering for upper/lower body&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mittens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these items have different brands and different price points. Starting off I just need one of each, but after time I can start collecting more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collection aspect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the hobby promote any type of collecting?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel collecting will come natural with snowboarding with all the attire needed to do snowboarding. Snowboards are unique and personal to the snowboarder. Collecting multiple snowboards to use would be fun especially if it is a special edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, going to many different resorts it would be nice to collect shirts/hats from all the different places I have been. Either to wear or display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology aspect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the hobby require the use of tech?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe once I am comfortable/good at snowboarding, I will want to record myself going down the slopes. Either with an action camera or a mini drone following me down. This requires buying and maintaining the tech as well as introduces a new hobby in video editing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to get into snowboarding, I hope is to practice in 2025 so that in 2026 I can be part of the Winter Olympics hype.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Studying Plan</title>

&lt;p&gt;It is official! My start date will be February 24, which means I have a little more than month to prepare for the role in some capacity. With the help of ChatGPT I was able to find some resources that will help me hit the ground running come Feb 24.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Trusted Advisor&lt;/em&gt; by David H&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read articles and Youtube videos on &lt;strong&gt;KPIs&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;dashboard design principles&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;data-driven decision-making&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practice business writing and writing concise reports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start waking up early (start 9-10 am then move it to 6-7 am)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the gym&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the gym and eating breakfast
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Study SQL and Tableau (an hour for each)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn about SAP Analytics Cloud (an hour)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Read &lt;em&gt;The Pyramid Principle: Logic in Writing and Thinking&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read 2 books and then have dinner and then read the other book&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substitute in learning R or reading articles/watching Youtube videos if you are not in the mood for one of the other subjects. Even if I start at 10 I should be done by 5-6 pm and that gives me time to relax and play video games or watch tv. Do this during the week and take the weekends off if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;focus-on-meal-prepping&#34;&gt;Focus on Meal Prepping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I need to stay home for the first year of my new job then I need to use my extra disposable income on eating right. Not necessarily healthy, but I need to focus on my protein intake. I hate to say it, but I need to do meal prep. I don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy doing it, but it is the only way to consistently hit calorie/protein goals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Moving To San Diego In 3 Years</title>
      <link>/posts/01_11_2025/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-chat-with-ai&#34;&gt;A Chat With AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My desire to move to San Diego (Southern California) has been intensifying recently. I wanted to see what I need to do to be able to move to San Diego in 3 years. I gave ChatGPT my information from a financial and job experience standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;financial&#34;&gt;Financial&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a financial standpoint because of my job I am in a pretty good position. I do need to build up an emergency fund, which I was going to do regardless if I was moving to San Diego. The cost of living in Chicago is not that much different from San Diego in terms of apartments. The amenities of the apartment/building might be a little different but that is negated by the fact you are within a walkable distance to the beach in San Diego and the weather is always beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;job-experience&#34;&gt;Job Experience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all comes down to job experience, unfortunately my company doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an office branch in/near San Diego. Working fully remote with my current employer is a possibility, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to just relay on that. Lucky for me San Diego has a technology sector, specifically in data science. If I can position myself with the data solutions my company has in the first year, it can make me desirable when the time comes to try and find a job in the San Diego job market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies to look into are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Qualcomm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teradata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ServiceNow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using my employer&amp;rsquo;s tuition reimbursement benefit to get a Master&amp;rsquo;s in Data Analytics in the 3 years while I prepare myself would be tremendously beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scouting&#34;&gt;Scouting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to explore San Diego and other Southern California areas (Oceanside, Orange County). I think the minimum would have to be 2 trips a year to get a sense of the city. Discover the nice areas and the areas to stay away from. Also to discover the businesses that make living in San Diego worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This requires a lot more information so I will continue this thought in another post.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;afternoon&#34;&gt;Afternoon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was finally added to CrashCourse&amp;rsquo;s Jellyfin server after two days of waiting. I am excited to get back to watching tv shows or movies at night. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about Animal Kingdom, crime/drug family running its operation in southern California. Think Son&amp;rsquo;s of Anarchy meets The OC, well that is what I think the show is about. I might finish the Wishmaster movie series, the first one I watched on Youtube and it was funny. Not scary at all, but  does the job of entertaining me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;My package from GNC came in today containing Ghost energy drink, Barbell protein bar box, and some type of peanut butter protein cookie box. I really want to start hitting my goal of 150g of protein a day. These items will help in adding a bit of variety in hitting that goal over chicken breast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;night&#34;&gt;Night&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too cold to go to the garage gym today, so I did about 120 reps of dumbbell curls in my room. It was an ok workout, but I need to go to LA Fitness/Xsport and see what their basic plan is. Their online New Years promo is terrible as it is only for the premier plan. If I can&amp;rsquo;t find a gym soon I will have to suck it up and do the garage gym, even if it is 10 degrees outside and the heater doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;night&#34;&gt;Night&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished setting up my blog using Obsidian as my home for creating a post. I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;https://gohugo.io/&lt;/a&gt; to style my blog/post automatically and have it be easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Obsidian files and Hugo files are uploaded to my Github which is linked to my hosting site &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hostinger.com/&#34;&gt;https://www.hostinger.com/&lt;/a&gt; via a webhook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One script command is used in the terminal to make everything happen. So, I make my post in Obsidian and then run the script and my blog post is uploaded to the internet. Images will upload as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very excited to start my blogging journey where I will just write about my day. The point is to motivate me to do something&amp;hellip;anything! If I can&amp;rsquo;t write about something then that means I had a very unproductive day. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be productive but if I write about playing a new video game and that is all I have for that day, then that is a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is that I will force myself to&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;workout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learn something new&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;go somewhere new&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start a new hobby&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plan a future trip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;seriously anything!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in order to create a somewhat compelling post. The goal is to do this for all of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
