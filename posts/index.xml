      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;focus-on-meal-prepping&#34;&gt;Focus on Meal Prepping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I need to stay home for the first year of my new job then I need to use my extra disposable income on eating right. Not necessarily healthy, but I need to focus on my protein intake. I hate to say it, but I need to do meal prep. I don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy doing it, but it is the only way to consistently hit calorie/protein goals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I hate to say it, but I need to do meal prep. I don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy doing it, but it is the only way to consistently hit calorie/protein goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start basic with just one meal and slowly add in other meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;prep-1&#34;&gt;Prep 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Breakfast 
	- Oats
	- Almond milk
	- peanut butter powder
	- Greek yogurt (strawberry)
	- honey
	- granola
	- frozen raspberries, blueberries, blackberries

Snack
	- Oatmeal Cookie
	- peanut butter 

	- Kale
	- Granny Smith Apples
	- Honey Mustard

Dinner 
	- Frozen chicken breast 
	- Marinated overnight for taste and to tenderize 
	- Frozen veggie mix 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these items can be obtained at Costco/Sam&amp;rsquo;s Club&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Moving To San Diego In 3 Years</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-chat-with-ai&#34;&gt;A Chat With AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My desire to move to San Diego (Southern California) has been intensifying recently. I wanted to see what I need to do to be able to move to San Diego in 3 years. I gave ChatGPT my information from a financial and job experience standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;financial&#34;&gt;Financial&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a financial standpoint because of my job I am in a pretty good position. I do need to build up an emergency fund, which I was going to do regardless if I was moving to San Diego. The cost of living in Chicago is not that much different from San Diego in terms of apartments. The amenities of the apartment/building might be a little different but that is negated by the fact you are within a walkable distance to the beach in San Diego and the weather is always beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;job-experience&#34;&gt;Job Experience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all comes down to job experience, unfortunately my company doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an office branch in/near San Diego. Working fully remote with my current employer is a possibility, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to just relay on that. Lucky for me San Diego has a technology sector, specifically in data science. If I can position myself with the data solutions my company has in the first year, it can make me desirable when the time comes to try and find a job in the San Diego job market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies to look into are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Qualcomm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teradata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ServiceNow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using my employer&amp;rsquo;s tuition reimbursement benefit to get a Master&amp;rsquo;s in Data Analytics in the 3 years while I prepare myself would be tremendously beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scouting&#34;&gt;Scouting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to explore San Diego and other Southern California areas (Oceanside, Orange County). I think the minimum would have to be 2 trips a year to get a sense of the city. Discover the nice areas and the areas to stay away from. Also to discover the businesses that make living in San Diego worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This requires a lot more information so I will continue this thought in another post.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;afternoon&#34;&gt;Afternoon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was finally added to CrashCourse&amp;rsquo;s Jellyfin server after two days of waiting. I am excited to get back to watching tv shows or movies at night. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about Animal Kingdom, crime/drug family running its operation in southern California. Think Son&amp;rsquo;s of Anarchy meets The OC, well that is what I think the show is about. I might finish the Wishmaster movie series, the first one I watched on Youtube and it was funny. Not scary at all, but  does the job of entertaining me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;My package from GNC came in today containing Ghost energy drink, Barbell protein bar box, and some type of peanut butter protein cookie box. I really want to start hitting my goal of 150g of protein a day. These items will help in adding a bit of variety in hitting that goal over chicken breast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;night&#34;&gt;Night&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too cold to go to the garage gym today, so I did about 120 reps of dumbbell curls in my room. It was an ok workout, but I need to go to LA Fitness/Xsport and see what their basic plan is. Their online New Years promo is terrible as it is only for the premier plan. If I can&amp;rsquo;t find a gym soon I will have to suck it up and do the garage gym, even if it is 10 degrees outside and the heater doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I Setup My Blog!</title>

&lt;p&gt;I finished setting up my blog using Obsidian as my home for creating a post. I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;https://gohugo.io/&lt;/a&gt; to style my blog/post automatically and have it be easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Obsidian files and Hugo files are uploaded to my Github which is linked to my hosting site &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hostinger.com/&#34;&gt;https://www.hostinger.com/&lt;/a&gt; via a webhook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One script command is used in the terminal to make everything happen. So, I make my post in Obsidian and then run the script and my blog post is uploaded to the internet. Images will upload as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very excited to start my blogging journey where I will just write about my day. The point is to motivate me to do something&amp;hellip;anything! If I can&amp;rsquo;t write about something then that means I had a very unproductive day. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be productive but if I write about playing a new video game and that is all I have for that day, then that is a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is that I will force myself to&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;workout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learn something new&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;go somewhere new&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start a new hobby&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plan a future trip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;seriously anything!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in order to create a somewhat compelling post. The goal is to do this for all of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
