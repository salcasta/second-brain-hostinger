## Night


I finished setting up my blog using Obsidian as my home for creating a post. I used https://gohugo.io/ to style my blog/post automatically and have it be easy. 

My Obsidian files and Hugo files are uploaded to my Github which is linked to my hosting site https://www.hostinger.com/ via a webhook.

One script command is used in the terminal to make everything happen. So, I make my post in Obsidian and then run the script and my blog post is uploaded to the internet. Images will upload as well. 

## Why?

I'm very excited to start my blogging journey where I will just write about my day. The point is to motivate me to do something...anything! If I can't write about something then that means I had a very unproductive day. It doesn't need to be productive but if I write about playing a new video game and that is all I have for that day, then that is a problem.

The goal is that I will force myself to...

- workout
- read
- cook
- learn something new
- go somewhere new
- start a new hobby
- plan a future trip
- seriously anything!

in order to create a somewhat compelling post. The goal is to do this for all of 2025.
