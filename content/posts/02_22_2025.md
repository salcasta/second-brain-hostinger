## 3 Pronged Attack

I have one year of employment guaranteed, but after that it is unknown due to the uncertainty of the economy and the situation with the Federal government. I have devised a plan to utilize the following year to ensure I get a job as quickly as possible if I am not retained with my current employer. 

### SAP Certificates 

The first course of action is to get 2 SAP certificates. One with their most used software Ariba and the other will be a data analytics solution of my choosing. This will allow me to target companies that use the same software. This could be a major advantage for me since 90% of Fortune 500 companies use SAP software. 

### Networking / Cybersecurity 

The second course of action is to familiarize myself with another sector of the tech industry. I recently came across a Youtuber named NetworkChuck and he has introduced me to the IT side of the industry. He recently created a roadmap for people looking to get into IT. It involves getting 3 certificates and the time period is one year to have enough time to learn and study for the 3 certificates.

	2) free option - Professor Messer (Youtube)

	- while studying for CompTIA A+ learn **linux** and **python** 

2) Security via CompTIA Security+ 
	1) 1 exam - $404
	2) free option - Professor Messer (Youtube)
	3) premium option - ITPro

3) Networking via Cisco CCNA or CompTIA Network+

		2) free option - Jeremy's IT Labs
	2) For CompTIA Network+ 
		1) 1 exam - $369
		2) free option - Professor Messer (Youtube)

4) OPTIONAL Hacking via eJPT or CompTIA PenTest+ or CPTS or OSCP

	2) For CompTIA PenTest+
		1) 1 exam - $301

	4) For OSCP

		2) only pursue after you have an IT job or have been retained by current employer


### Data Analytics / Investment Banking 

For this final course of action I will continue learning SQL, R, Tableau, Python Pandas from DataCamp. I will also learn how to use these analytical skills in the finance sector. To break into investment banking, private equity, or venture capital it will take more than learning online to get a job. Social networking will be needed to land a job, but learning online will make me knowledgable when discussing on the subject. 

| **Platform**                    | **Best For**                           | **Cost**          | **Strength**                         |

| **Break Into Wall Street**      | Intensive modeling & technical prep    | $497/course       | Lifetime access & advanced materials |

### Final Thoughts

The plan is to stay in the office and study as well as on the weekends. This is meant to be done in my free time and is not meant to be a vigorous study plan. The job comes first no matter what and this whole plan assumes I will have a good handle on things at work.
