## Afternoon

I was finally added to CrashCourse's Jellyfin server after two days of waiting. I am excited to get back to watching tv shows or movies at night. I'm thinking about Animal Kingdom, crime/drug family running its operation in southern California. Think Son's of Anarchy meets The OC, well that is what I think the show is about. I might finish the Wishmaster movie series, the first one I watched on Youtube and it was funny. Not scary at all, but  does the job of entertaining me. 

My package from GNC came in today containing Ghost energy drink, Barbell protein bar box, and some type of peanut butter protein cookie box. I really want to start hitting my goal of 150g of protein a day. These items will help in adding a bit of variety in hitting that goal over chicken breast. 


## Night

Too cold to go to the garage gym today, so I did about 120 reps of dumbbell curls in my room. It was an ok workout, but I need to go to LA Fitness/Xsport and see what their basic plan is. Their online New Years promo is terrible as it is only for the premier plan. If I can't find a gym soon I will have to suck it up and do the garage gym, even if it is 10 degrees outside and the heater doesn't work.
