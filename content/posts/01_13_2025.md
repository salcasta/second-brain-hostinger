## Focus on Meal Prepping 

If I need to stay home for the first year of my new job then I need to use my extra disposable income on eating right. Not necessarily healthy, but I need to focus on my protein intake. I hate to say it, but I need to do meal prep. I don't enjoy doing it, but it is the only way to consistently hit calorie/protein goals. 

Start basic with just one meal and slowly add in other meals. 

### Prep 1

	Breakfast 
		- Oats
		- Almond milk
		- peanut butter powder
		- Greek yogurt (strawberry)
		- honey

		- Granny Smith Apples
