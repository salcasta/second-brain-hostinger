## Crafting a Studying Plan 

It is official! My start date will be February 24, which means I have a little more than month to prepare for the role in some capacity. With the help of ChatGPT I was able to find some resources that will help me hit the ground running come Feb 24. 

#### Technical 

- Continue to learn SQL via DataCamp
- Learn more about Tableau via DataCamp
- Learn about SAP Analytics Cloud via SAP Learning Hub
- Pick a cloud platform to learn (not as important now)
- Learn more about Python or R (probably best to focus on R for now)


#### Business / Consulting

- Learn about how businesses use analytics to set strategy and solve problems 
	- _Storytelling with Data_ by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic

- Learn the basics of a project management frameworks (either Agile or Scrum)
- Prepare for interacting with sales team members and customers
	- _The Trusted Advisor_ by David H

- Read articles and Youtube videos on **KPIs**, **dashboard design principles**, and **data-driven decision-making**.
- Practice business writing and writing concise reports
	- _The Pyramid Principle: Logic in Writing and Thinking_ by Barbara Minto.


### The Schedule 

- Start waking up early (start 9-10 am then move it to 6-7 am)
	- Go to the gym
- After the gym and eating breakfast 
	- Study SQL and Tableau (an hour for each)
	- Learn about SAP Analytics Cloud (an hour)
- After eating lunch
	- Read _Storytelling with Data_ 
	- Read _The Trusted Advisor_
	- Read _The Pyramid Principle: Logic in Writing and Thinking_
- Read 2 books and then have dinner and then read the other book 


Substitute in learning R or reading articles/watching Youtube videos if you are not in the mood for one of the other subjects. Even if I start at 10 I should be done by 5-6 pm and that gives me time to relax and play video games or watch tv. Do this during the week and take the weekends off if needed.
